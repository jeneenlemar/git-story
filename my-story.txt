This story is about our adventures in coding. Today, our adventure will take me and the other No-Click-Clique mates to the land of GIT. Hopefully, I won't get kidnapped by little GITties!  
The little GITties might try to capture all of us, and OMG that would be a major undertaking!!!! We are a fiesty and creative bunch so if the GITties caught us, we could code our way out of it!
Because of our awesomeness in learning to code, we use our keyboard shortcuts to tap out commands and blast away our enemies!
